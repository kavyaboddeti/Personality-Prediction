# Personality-Prediction

## Overview

In the intersection of psychology and technology, our project shines a light on the fascinating realm of personality prediction using the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the most popular personality assessment tool globally. We harness the power of machine learning to analyze social media posts, offering a novel approach to understanding human personality. Our project not only aims to enhance recommendation systems and human-robot interaction but also to provide a reliable alternative to traditional personality assessments.

## Why MBTI?

MBTI classifies individuals into 16 distinct personality types based on four dichotomies: Introversion vs. Extroversion, Intuition vs. Sensing, Thinking vs. Feeling, and Judging vs. Perceiving. Despite its wide usage, MBTI assessments face challenges in reliability. Our project addresses these concerns by introducing a machine learning-based classifier that aims for higher accuracy and reliability, making personality predictions more accessible and dependable.

## Project Components

### Data Collection

- **Source**: A dataset comprising 50 recent social media posts per user, annotated with MBTI personality types.
- **Access**: Available for download [here](#).

### Machine Learning Models

Our toolkit includes a variety of algorithms, each chosen for its strengths in handling text data and classification tasks:

- **Logistic Regression**: A foundational model for binary outcomes, extended to multiclass classification for MBTI types.
- **Naive Bayes**: Particularly suited for text classification, based on frequency and distribution of words.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble approach that builds multiple decision trees for robust predictions.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Leverages similarity metrics to classify posts based on their nearest labeled neighbors.
- **SGD Classifier**: Adapts Stochastic Gradient Descent for efficient learning, ideal for large datasets.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Employs kernel tricks to handle high-dimensional space, excellent for text classification.
